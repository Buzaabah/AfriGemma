Igo\n\nHarvard University Press; 398pp; $35\n\n\nReviews below)\n\nEditor's Review\n\nThe Good A fascinating glimpse at the world of social science research and scientific polling.\n\nThe Bad The academic writing style is occasionally a tough slog.\n\nThe Bottom Line A rewarding look at the evolution of an information revolution.\n\nWith all of the data now available on consumers' wants and needs, it's hard to imagine that less than a century ago market research consisted of little more than knowing the number of widgets your business sold in Muncie. Then, in the years after World War I, commerce was revolutionized by the dawning of modern social science research and scientific polling techniques. A fascinating glimpse of the upheaval that forever altered the way Americans see themselves, sell products, and operate election campaigns may be found in The Averaged American: Surveys, Citizens, and the Making of a Mass Public by University of Pennsylvania historian Sarah E. Igo.\n\nIt was a rocky road to social transformation. In the early years of scientific research, Igo writes, it took a lot of work \"to persuade business owners...that collecting information about their customers' buying habits was worthwhile.\" Many did not believe that citizens would answer prying questions about personal habits or political views from strangers knocking on their doors. And a large number of skeptics, she observes, did not \"trust the assembled answers as either trustworthy or true.\"\n\nIgo, a rising star among American historians, presents detailed analyses of three milestones in the emerging field of survey research: Robert and Helen Lynd's best-selling Middletown studies of 1929 and 1937, which dissected the lives of residents of an unnamed, average town in Middle America (Muncie, Ind.); the creation by George Gallup and Elmo Roper of the first public opinion polls in 1935; and Alfred Kinsey's shocking sexual-behavior reports of 1948 and 1953.\n\nThe key for the survey-research industry was defining \"the average American.\" That's the everyman (yes, in those days, marketers wanted to appeal to \"the man of the house\") who will buy your products or vote for your candidate. As Newsweek noted in 1947, \"a shadowy figure [is] beginning to emerge...American majority man.\"\n\nBut, as Igo wisely notes, the search for the average American intentionally excluded large swaths of the population. The Lynds' Middletown research excluded African Americans and immigrants, and Kinsey limited his sexual studies to Caucasians. Early polling often undersampled the poor, racial minorities, immigrants, Southerners, and others seen as less likely to purchase consumer goods or vote. \"Even if [the portrait] was never particularly accurate or representative,\" Igo writes, the new typical Americans played \"a vital role in consolidating the [concept of a] national public.\"\n\nThe world of surveys spawned businesses that were designed to explain these average Americans and \"the public\" to those who would buy the data, from politicians to companies. Business Week in 1934 called the Lynds' work \"a godsend to marketers.\" Gallup saw similarities in how people think \"from politics to toothpaste.\" Roper predicted that the science of polling would become \"a veritable gold mine if we could learn fast enough how to use it in all of its ramifications.\"\n\nIt did become a gold mine for Roper, as he signed up companies that were eager to sell their products to average Americans. Among the first to embrace the new way of doing business: Ford Motor (F), Standard Oil, the American Meat Institute, the National Broadcasting Co., RCA Victor, and the Spiegel catalog company.\n\nAs the polling business became more sophisticated, Gallup and others began to study gender, class, and geographical differences to help clients appeal to groups once \"routinely ignored,\" including housewives, Southerners, and blue-collar workers. With the coming of the civil rights movement and the sexual revolution of the 1960s, \"pollsters recalibrated their strong majoritarian frame, detecting new significance in how men and women, young and old, Latinos and Asian Americans assessed presidents and purchases differently.\" Niche markets and microtargeting became buzzwords on Madison Avenue.\n\nAt the dawn of the 21st century, survey research is continuing to evolve. Using state-of-the-art technology, pollsters examine brain scans to determine which product pitches or political platforms cause flashes of neural activity. The growth of Internet polling has raised debates over the scientific validity of Web-based survey techniques.\n\nPolling, once considered a scandalous invasion of privacy, is now an accepted practice. More than 20% of Americans were polled at least once in the past year. As Igo aptly concludes, \"we will continue to live in a world shaped by, and perceived through, survey data.\"\n\nBy Richard S.

A\nchain of circumstances touching their two lives hurled them into marriage, and\nthe opportunity for the intimacy with a woman for which Hugh so longed came to\nhim with a swiftness that made him fairly dizzy.\nIt was a Wednesday evening and cloudy. After dining in silence with his landlady,\nHugh started along Turner's Pike toward Bidwell, but when he had got almost\ninto town, turned back. He had left the house intending to go through town to the\nMedina Road and to the woman who now occupied so large a place in his\nthoughts, but hadn't the courage. Every evening for almost a week he had taken\nthe walk, and every evening and at almost the same spot he turned back. He\nwas disgusted and angry with himself and went to his shop, walking in the middle\nof the road and kicking up clouds of dust. People passed along the path under\nthe trees at the side of the road and turned to stare at him. A workingman with a\nfat wife, who puffed as she walked at his side, turned to look and then began to\nscold. \"I tell you what, old woman, I shouldn't have married and had kids,\" he\ngrumbled. \"Look at me, then look at that fellow. He goes along there thinking big\nthoughts that will make him richer and richer. I have to work for two dollars a day,\nand pretty soon I'll be old and thrown on the scrap-heap. I might have been a rich\ninventor like him had I given myself a chance.\"\nThe workman went on his way, grumbling at his wife who paid no attention to his\nwords. Her breath was needed for the labor of walking, and as for the matter of\nmarriage, that had been attended to. She saw no reason for wasting words over\nthe matter. Hugh went to the shop and stood leaning against the door frame. Two\nor three workmen were busy near the back door and had lighted gas lamps that\nhung over the work benches. They did not see Hugh, and their voices ran\nthrough the empty building. One of them, an old man with a bald head,\nentertained his fellows by giving an imitation of Steve Hunter. He lighted a cigar\nand putting on his hat tipped it a little to one side. Puffing out his chest he\nmarched up and down talking of money. \"Here's a ten-dollar cigar,\" he said,\nhanding a long stogie to one of the other workmen. \"I buy them by the thousands\nto give away. I'm interested in uplifting the lives of workmen in my home town.\nThat's what takes all my attention.\"\nThe other workmen laughed and the little man continued to prance up and down\nand talk, but Hugh did not hear him. He stared moodily at the people going along\nthe road toward town. Darkness was coming but he could still see dim figures\nstriding along. Over at the foundry back of the corn-cutting machine plant the\nnight shift was pouring off, and a sudden glare of light played across the heavy\nsmoke cloud that lay over the town. The bells of the churches began to call\npeople to the Wednesday evening prayer-meetings. Some enterprising citizen\nhad begun to build workmen's houses in a field beyond Hugh's shop and these\nwere occupied by Italian laborers. A crowd of them came past. What would some\nday be a tenement district was growing in a field beside a cabbage patch"}

For many years, it was an enigma as to how these cells can escape from the bloodstream. This is no trivial feat, given that specialized blood vessels act as a barrier between the nervous system and the bloodstream. Until now, tissue sections provided the sole evidence that the immune cells really do manage to reach the nerve cells. Now, a team of scientists from the Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology, the University Medical Center Göttingen, and other institutes, has witnessed the movements of these cells \"live\" under the microscope for the very first time. In the process, they discovered several new behavioural traits of the immune cells. The consolidated findings mark a significant step forward in our understanding of this complex disease. ( Nature, 14 October 2009)\n\nThe brain and the spinal cord monitor and control the functions of all body parts and co-ordinate the whole organism's movements, senses and behaviour. Adequate protection of the brain and spinal cord are therefore of the utmost importance. Physical influences and injuries are warded off by the cranial bone and the vertebral column. Dangers lurking within the body, such as viruses circulating in the bloodstream, are kept at bay by highly specialized blood vessels. The vessels' walls form a barrier that cannot be penetrated by the cells or various other small particles, thus serving to protect the delicate nerve cells.\n\nre: the video: The film shows in real time how the green labeled T-cells creep along the inside walls of blood vessels before single cells force their way through the vessels' walls and...\n\nNot yet receiving the Stu's Views and MS News weekly Multiple Sclerosis e-Newsletter?\n\nPost a comment\nWrite a comment:\n\nRelated Searches"}
