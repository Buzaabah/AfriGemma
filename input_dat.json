I\u2019m plugged in to the router with Ethernet.\n\n\nIt seems goofy, right? Here\u2019s the scoop: Your internet connection doesn\u2019t give away your exact location. (Your ISP knows your address and could reveal it to the po-po, but it\u2019s not public info.) So Apple uses wifi to triangulate the position of your computer based on the location of wifi networks that the Mac can detect.\n\nThey did the same thing on the iPhone before it had real GPS.\n\nAuthor: jjmarcus\n\nMac Whisperer, Cloud Integrator, Gadget Wrangler, Content Beautifier\n\nLeave a Reply\n\n\nYou are commenting using your account.

But starting in the 1980s, lethal injection became the preferred method of execution, according to Hannaford.\n\n\nSince 2009, the safest forms of execution drugs have been difficult for states to acquire. A key producer in North Carolina stopped making one of the drugs. Human rights groups and defense attorneys have also used media campaigns and lawsuits to shut down other supply chains, according to Hannaford.\n\nFor example, pentobarbital is the drug Louisiana would like to use in its executions, but the state has not been able to buy it for several months. In January, Louisiana corrections officials amended the state's death penalty protocol to allow other drugs to be used in state executions.\n\nHannaford explains why pentobarbital might be hard to find in the following passage:\n\n\nRead more of Hannaford's article here.\n\n. . . . . .\n", "url": "http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/07/how_the_death_penalty_has_been.html", "warcinfo": "robots: classic\r\nhostname: ip-10-180-206-219.ec2.internal\r\nsoftware: Nutch 1.6 (CC)/CC WarcExport 1.0\r\nisPartOf: CC-MAIN-2015-22\r\noperator: CommonCrawl Admin\r\ndescription: Wide crawl of the web for May 2015\r\npublisher: CommonCrawl\r\nformat: WARC File Format 1.0\r\nconformsTo: http://bibnum.bnf.fr/WARC/WARC_ISO_28500_version1_latestdraft.pdf", "fasttext_openhermes_reddit_eli5_vs_rw_v2_bigram_200k_train_prob": 0.1315024495124817}
